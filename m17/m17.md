# Introduction

## M17 Digital Mode and the CS7000-M17

The M17 digital mode is a digital radio protocol developed by 
[The M17 Project](https://m17project.org) as an alternative to commercially
developed digital radio protocols for and by amateur radio operators. The
M17 protocol is free to use, open source, and utilizes an open source voice
codec called [Codec 2](https://www.rowetel.com/wordpress/?page_id=452),
developed by David Rowe `VK5DGR`, freeing the use of the M17 protocol from
patent or commercial copyright and licensing encumberances.

The basic premise of the M17 protocol is to allow both commercial and
non-commercial (e.g. open source developers) to create hardware and
software with a digital RF protocol that is free to use. With this in mind,
the CSI CS7000-M17 is the first handheld radio that is commercially available
with no hardware modifications needed to the radio. Through the hard work of
OpenRTX, CSI, and the M17 Project, we present to you the fruits of our labor
and passion for amateur radio.

## What to do now

The CS7000-M17 radio ships (as of 28 JUL 2024) with the CSI DMR firmware loaded.
You will need to reprogram the radio (a process called 'flashing') with the
OpenRTX firmware provided by Connect Systems. 

| :exclamation: 28 JUL 2024 - Be aware that the firmware from CSI is in an ALPHA state. Bugs are present and to be expected! |

The instructions for flashing the radio to the OpenRTX firmware can be found on
the [Flashing M17](m17/flashing_m17.md) page.
